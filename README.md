# Metropolia UAS: First Year Web Development Assignment - Trekking Treasure
This repository showcases my first web page development assignment using HTML and CSS, completed during my first year at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. The assignment includes building a simple webpage with menu, product catalog and contact. The website is built for an imaginary company called Trekking Treasure, providing trekkers with guided trekking tour to explore the nature.

In this assignment, the focus was to develop the website frontend. Consequently, the backend code is not utilized here. To view my project with backend functionalities, view [Vaccine Voyage 2.0](https://github.com/TaysaAbinader/VaccineVoyage2.0)
